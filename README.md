There are two parts to this program. First we do the preprocessing of data. This is performed in the preprocess.py. To run this file, we need to ensure we have all the data provided.

Once you have the data, run the following command in the terminal. 
			
					python preprocess.py

Next, for the model selection run,

					python model_select.py
					
To run the Neural network model with grid search for parameter tuning run,

					python NN.py
					
The notebooks used for experimenting are also included in the html format. Please ensure to unzip the file to view all the figures and plots properly.
